# (Not really) Fried Rice
> v1  

A cheap way to survive the Netherlands.
I started this experiement because I'm trying to save money.

### Ingredients  ###

1. Rice 1.5 (~200g) cups
2. Vegetable/Kip Buillion Cubes - 1 cube
3. Bell Pepper - 1/3rd
4. Carrots - 1 medium
5. Spring Onion - 1 stem
6. Onion - 1 small or 0.5 medium
7. Oil - 1 tbsp.
8. Eggs - 2 med
9. Ginger Garlic Paste - 1 tsp.
10. Ketjap Manis / Asin or Soya Saus - 1 tbsp.
11. Chilli Oil - 1 or 2 tsp.
12. Ketchup - optional

### How do I set it up? ###

* Add 1 buillion cube to 3 cups of water sufficently large vessel.
* Bring it to boil.
* Wash 1.5 Cups of rice and then add it to above boiling mixture (Set a timer for ~8min or depending on your rice).
> 1.5 cups (for me) is enough for 3 servings. I prepare extra rice to use later. Feel free to change the amount of rice. 
> Different types rices have different cooking methods.
* Take 1 carrot and cut into two pieces.
* Cut thin circular slices from first half.
* Cut thin long slices from the second half.
* Dice the onion into small cubes.
* Cut the bell pepper into thin long pices.
* Cut the spring onion into small circular rings.
* Heat 1 tbsp. oil in a large bowl and add 1 tsp. ginger garlic paste.
* When it turns sligly golden brown, add the onions.
* Sauté for around a minute on mid-low flame and add the carrots and bell peppers.
* Sauté on low flame for around a minute and then add all the white rings and most of the green rings
* Add salt to taste and sauté for 3-4mins on mid flame.
* Once cooked (easy to break white the spoon/doesn't feel raw) add the (cooked) rice.
* Keep frying till everthing is mixed (~1 minute)
* Turn the flame to low, and push the mixture aside to make a small opening in the centre of the bowl.
* Break two eggs in that space add salt and some of the remaining spring onion rings
* Mix the eggs locally to break the yolks; increase the flame slighly to scramble the eggs
* Once satified mix the scrabmbled eggs with the rice
* Keep cooking (on low flame) till eggs are scrambled and cook some more
* Turn the flame off and add 1 tbsp of ketjap manis or soya saus
* Mix well then add 1tsp. of chilli oil
* Garnish with the remaining sping onion rings
* Enjoy

### Testing & Tasting ###

#### December 2022 ####
> Been having this for dinner for almost 4 days now    
> The prep is a little time consuming    
> The taste a good enough    
> It is not like the regular fried rice, the eggs makes it sticky which I don't mind    
> Needs more salt    
> Different colored bell peppers have different taste, but beggars can't be choosers I buy the cheapest
