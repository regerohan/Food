# Instant Oats
> v1  

An alternative to the instant noodles. I started this experiement because I love instant noodles, but they don't love me back.

### Ingredients  ###

1. Oats 1.5 cups
1. Smith & Jones Pasta masala
1. Water 3 cups

### How do I get set up? ###

* Bring 3 cups of water to boil in a sufficently large vessel.
* Add the oats, and keep mixing, until the mixture turns viscous.
* Bring it to the consistency of "Baked beans in sauce"
* Add 1.5 of pasta masala.
* Mix till uniform
* Enjoy

### Testing & Tasting ###

#### 28Feb2021 ####
> * I coudn't find the masala packet in time hence had to reheat the oats, to mix the masala.  
> * Only added 1/4 packet, but that wan't enough.  
> * Tasted decent, but oats unlike the instant noodles have a slightly sweet taste when you chew into them.  
> * Felt hungry again after ~ 1.5hrs.  
> * Overall a solid 5/10

#### 1Mar2021 ####
> * Added masala when the water was boiling, oats foam a lot and caused lot of clumps    
> * Added 3 cups of water, 1.5 cups of oats, 1.5 packets of masala.  
> * New ratio is 'N ml' , 'N/2 ml' of oats and 'N/2 packets' of masala.  
> * Tasted same as yesterday.
> * Still weirded about the sweet taste.  
> * Felt hungry again after ~ 1.5hrs.  
> * Overall a solid 5/10.
